# Net free-throw attempts analysis

Let's delve into the statistical analysis of the LA Lakers performance over the past two seasons (2022-23, 2023-24) to ascertain whether they indeed hold a consistent advantage in free throw attempts compared to their opponents in every game.

In sports analytics, we employ a metric known as **Net Free Throw Attempts (NFTA)**, which is derived by subtracting the total number of free throw attempts by the opposing team from the total number of free throw attempts by the target team for each game throughout the season. This provides a comprehensive measure of a team's efficacy in drawing fouls and capitalizing on free scoring opportunities.

Here you can see the [raw data](https://github.com/NocturneBear/NBA-Data-2010-2024) and the [SQL script](https://github.com/NocturneBear/NBA-hot-take-analysis/blob/main/Net%20free-throw%20attempts/NetDifferenceFreeThrows.sql) that calculated this metric, and here is the [final data](https://github.com/NocturneBear/NBA-hot-take-analysis/blob/main/Net%20free-throw%20attempts/NetDifferenceFreeThrows.csv) that I got before visualisation.

Upon examination of the visual representation of the data, it becomes apparent that the LA Lakers consistently maintain a higher Net FTA compared to their competitors.

This trend is not only noticeable but also accentuates over the span of the last two seasons. Such a substantial disparity in free throw attempts undoubtedly confers a significant advantage upon the LA Lakers during gameplay.

To further elucidate the magnitude of this advantage, bubble chart is used to provide a graphical representation of the distribution of free throw attempts in comparison to other teams in the league.

Further, this is purely my subjective opinion and should not be taken as something correct.

In essence, the surge in ratings, viewership, and merchandise sales during the NBA playoffs can largely be attributed to the presence of LeBron James on the court.

LeBron's remarkable influence has been cultivated over his years in the league, a dominance that often manifests in-game through his adeptness at exerting pressure on referees.

Thus, delving into LeBron's impact on the NBA becomes a compelling avenue for future analysis. The Lakers tendency to commit more fouls and subsequent free throws than their opponents is particularly evident in the statistics.
